CB3017 will broadly cover the fundamentals of evolutionary biology with respect to pathogens and then looking at case studies from bacteria, virus and fungus.

### Foundations of Evolutionary Theory and Population Genetics
Darwinian evolution and natural selection applied to pathogens. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and deviations in microbial populations. Mutation, migration, genetic drift, and selection in pathogen populations.
Evolution of Antibiotic Resistance in Bacteria

### Genetic Analysis of Pathogens and Resistance Mechanisms. 
Fitness landscapes and adaptive evolution. Modeling selective pressures using vaccine introduction and antibiotic use. Pathogen genomics and identification of resistance genes. Model mechanisms of drug resistance in bacteria using case studies of *E.coli*, *K.pneumoniae* and/or *M.tuberculosis*.

### Evolution of Oncogenic Viruses in Humans
Mechanisms of oncogenesis by viruses, integration, latency, and viral protein interactions. Co-evolution of oncogenic viruses and host immune responses using case studies from Human Papillomavirus (HPV) and Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV).

### Evolution of Fungal Plant Pathogens
Evolutionary mechanisms in plant pathogens, horizontal gene transfer, host jumps, and adaptive evolution in light of climate change. Co-evolution of plant hosts and pathogens, the arms race (Red Queen Hypothesis) and the gene-for-gene hypothesis. Case studies will include bacterial (*Xanthamonas*) and fungal species (*Phakopsora pachyrhizi* or similar and  *Phytophthora infestans* or similar)
