title: "Activity 2 - Analysis of Genomic Variation in Influenza A Virus Using Nucleotide Diversity (π)"
categories: misc
---

### Problem Statement  
Some genes evolve at a higher rate than others, leading to variations in genetic diversity across the genome. In this study, we aim to determine whether specific genes exhibit a higher evolutionary rate compared to others.  

To measure genomic variation, we use **nucleotide diversity** (π), a metric that quantifies the average number of nucleotide differences per site between any two randomly chosen sequences in a population. This analysis will allow us to:
- Calculate and interpret nucleotide diversity (π) across different genes.
- Compare evolutionary rates among genes.
- Discuss the limitations of π as a measure of genetic variation.

You will be provided with several thousand sequences of three genes—**Hemagglutinin (HA), Neuraminidase (NA), and M protein (M)**—from *Influenza A Virus*. Additionally, you will receive unique seed numbers (for reproducibility) and a Python script that subsets a number of samples/gene sequences (100, 200, 300, 400, 500), aligns, and estimates π for each seed run. Based on the generated dataset, you will answer the research question and explain possible causes with appropriate citations.

### Environment Setup  
To conduct the analysis, we will set up a computational environment on an HPC system using **Miniconda, Micromamba**, and install essential bioinformatics tools.

#### Login to HPC  
Access the HPC system via SSH:
```sh
ssh username@hpc-address
```
Replace `username` with your actual HPC username and `hpc-address` with the correct hostname or IP.

#### Install Miniconda  
##### Download Miniconda  
```sh
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```
##### Install Miniconda  
```sh
bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```
Follow the prompts:
- Press **Enter** to continue.
- Scroll through the license agreement using **Spacebar**, then type `yes` to accept.
- Choose an installation directory (default: `$HOME/miniconda3`).
- Type `yes` to initialize Miniconda.

##### Activate Miniconda  
Restart the shell or run:
```sh
source ~/.bashrc
```
Verify installation:
```sh
conda --version
```

#### Install Micromamba  
Micromamba is a lightweight alternative to Conda.
##### Install Micromamba  
```sh
conda install -n base -c conda-forge micromamba -y
```
##### Verify Micromamba Installation  
```sh
micromamba --version
```
###### In case of an error

Try the following command to see if micromamba is configured right!

```sh
echo 'eval "$(micromamba shell hook -s bash)"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

#### Create a New Environment  
Using Micromamba, create an environment named `pi` with required packages:
```sh
micromamba create -n pi -c conda-forge -c bioconda biopython mafft muscle \
ncbi-datasets-cli -y
```
Activate the environment:
```sh
micromamba activate pi
```
Verify the installed tools:
```sh
python -c "import Bio; print(Bio.__version__)"  # Biopython
mafft --version  # MAFFT
muscle -version  # MUSCLE
datasets version  # NCBI Datasets CLI
```

### Analysis  
With the computational environment set up at the DGX cluster, we can now analyze the genetic variation in the *Influenza A Virus* dataset.

#### Step 0: Copy the Dataset to your directory.

```sh
cp -r /dgxb_home/mulsf2653/classwork/flu flu_dataset
```

#### Step 1: Subset the Dataset  

There is a Python script `download_align_score.py` that subsets different sample sizes by using GenBank accession number from any one of three text files (`filter_HA.txt`, `filter_NA.txt` and `filter_M.txt`). The script then aligns the sequences using `muscle` or `mafft`. The aligned sequences are used to calculate nucleotide diversity for each subset and prints out the value of π to the terminal.

##### Available options in the script:
```sh
python download_align_score.py [-h] [--seed SEED] [--align] \
[-o OUTPUT_ALIGNMENT_FILE] [-n NUM_ACCESSIONS]
[--skip-download] [--skip-alignment] [--skip-diversity] \
[--rerun-download] [--rerun-alignment] [--aligner {muscle,mafft}] filepath
```
To run the script:
```sh
python download_align_score.py sequences.fasta \
  --output aln_sequences.fasta \
  --aligner mafft \
  --seed SEED_NUMBER -n SAMPLE_SIZE
```
Here:
- `SEED_NUMBER` refers to the assigned random seed.
- `SAMPLE_SIZE` is one of {100, 200, 300, 400, 500}.

#### Step 2: Interpret Results  
After computing π for different genes and sample sizes, fill out the following table, calculating the average π for each gene.

| Gene/Sample Size | 100 | 200 | 300 | 400 | 500 | Average |
|-----------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|---------|
| **HA**         |     |     |     |     |     |         |
| **NA**         |     |     |     |     |     |         |
| **M**          |     |     |     |     |     |         |

Analyze the results and make sure to address the following points. Add citations where appropriate.
- Compare π values across the three genes (HA, NA, M).
- Determine whether any gene evolves at a higher rate.
- Discuss factors influencing genetic variation (e.g., selection pressure, mutation rates).

#### Step 3: Limitations of Nucleotide Diversity  
While π is a useful metric, it has limitations. Discuss these limitations and suggest solutions to potentially overcome them in our analysis.

### Conclusion  
By analyzing nucleotide diversity in *Influenza A Virus*, we can infer evolutionary patterns and identify genes undergoing rapid evolution. However, additional metrics such as dN/dS ratios should be considered for a more comprehensive evolutionary analysis.
