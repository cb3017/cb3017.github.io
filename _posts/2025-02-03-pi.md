# Analysis of Genomic Variation in Influenza A Virus Using Nucleotide Diversity (\(\pi\))

## Author: Balan Ramesh  
Date: \today  

## Problem Statement  
Some genes evolve at a higher rate than others, leading to variations in genetic diversity across the genome. In this study, we aim to determine whether specific genes exhibit a higher evolutionary rate compared to others.  

To measure genomic variation, we use **nucleotide diversity** (\(\pi\)), a metric that quantifies the average number of nucleotide differences per site between any two randomly chosen sequences in a population. This analysis will allow us to:
- Calculate and interpret nucleotide diversity (\(\pi\)) across different genes.
- Compare evolutionary rates among genes.
- Discuss the limitations of \(\pi\) as a measure of genetic variation.

You will be provided with several thousand sequences of three genes—**Hemagglutinin (HA), Neuraminidase (NA), and M protein (M)**—from *Influenza A Virus*. Additionally, you will receive unique seed numbers (for reproducibility) and a Python script that subsets a number of samples/gene sequences (100, 200, 300, 400, 500), aligns, and estimates \(\pi\) for each seed run. Based on the generated dataset, you will answer the research question and explain possible causes with appropriate citations.

## Environment Setup  
To conduct the analysis, we will set up a computational environment on an HPC system using **Miniconda, Micromamba**, and install essential bioinformatics tools.

### Login to HPC  
Access the HPC system via SSH:
```sh
ssh username@hpc-address
```
Replace `username` with your actual HPC username and `hpc-address` with the correct hostname or IP.

### Install Miniconda  
#### Download Miniconda  
```sh
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```
#### Install Miniconda  
```sh
bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```
Follow the prompts:
- Press **Enter** to continue.
- Scroll through the license agreement using **Spacebar**, then type `yes` to accept.
- Choose an installation directory (default: `$HOME/miniconda3`).
- Type `yes` to initialize Miniconda.

#### Activate Miniconda  
Restart the shell or run:
```sh
source ~/.bashrc
```
Verify installation:
```sh
conda --version
```

### Install Micromamba  
Micromamba is a lightweight alternative to Conda.
#### Install Micromamba  
```sh
conda install -n base -c conda-forge micromamba -y
```
#### Verify Micromamba Installation  
```sh
micromamba --version
```

### Create a New Environment  
Using Micromamba, create an environment named `pi` with required packages:
```sh
micromamba create -n pi -c conda-forge -c bioconda biopython mafft muscle \
ncbi-datasets-cli -y
```
Activate the environment:
```sh
micromamba activate pi
```
Verify the installed tools:
```sh
python -c "import Bio; print(Bio.__version__)"  # Biopython
mafft --version  # MAFFT
muscle -version  # MUSCLE
datasets version  # NCBI Datasets CLI
```

## Analysis  
With the computational environment set up at the DGX cluster, we can now analyze the genetic variation in the *Influenza A Virus* dataset.

### Step 1: Subset the Dataset  
You will be provided with a Python script that subsets different sample sizes by using GenBank accession number. The script then aligns the sequences using `muscle` or `mafft`. The aligned sequences are used to calculate nucleotide diversity for each subset and prints out the value of \(\pi\).

#### Available options in the script:
```sh
python download_align_score.py [-h] [--seed SEED] [--align] \
[-o OUTPUT_ALIGNMENT_FILE] [-n NUM_ACCESSIONS]
[--skip-download] [--skip-alignment] [--skip-diversity] \
[--rerun-download] [--rerun-alignment] [--aligner {muscle,mafft}] filepath
```
To run the script:
```sh
python download_align_score.py sequences.fasta \
  --output aln_sequences.fasta \
  --aligner mafft \
  --seed SEED_NUMBER -n SAMPLE_SIZE
```
Here:
- `SEED_NUMBER` refers to the assigned random seed.
- `SAMPLE_SIZE` is one of {100, 200, 300, 400, 500}.

### Step 2: Interpret Results  
After computing \(\pi\) for different genes and sample sizes, fill out the following table, calculating the average \(\pi\) for each gene.

| Gene/Sample Size | 100 | 200 | 300 | 400 | 500 | Average |
|-----------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|---------|
| **HA**         |     |     |     |     |     |         |
| **NA**         |     |     |     |     |     |         |
| **M**          |     |     |     |     |     |         |

Analyze the results and make sure to address the following points. Add citations where appropriate.
- Compare \(\pi\) values across the three genes (HA, NA, M).
- Determine whether any gene evolves at a higher rate.
- Discuss factors influencing genetic variation (e.g., selection pressure, mutation rates).

### Step 3: Limitations of Nucleotide Diversity  
While \(\pi\) is a useful metric, it has limitations. Discuss these limitations and suggest solutions to potentially overcome them in our analysis.

## Conclusion  
By analyzing nucleotide diversity in *Influenza A Virus*, we can infer evolutionary patterns and identify genes undergoing rapid evolution. However, additional metrics such as dN/dS ratios should be considered for a more comprehensive evolutionary analysis.
