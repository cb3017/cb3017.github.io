Why Evolutionary Biology?

The study of evolutionary biology is fundamental because it provides the framework to understand the diversity and complexity of life on Earth. Without evolution, biology would be a collection of disconnected facts, unable to explain the "why" behind life's patterns, adaptations, and relationships. This is best summarized by a famous quote which is as follows.

> "Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution." - Theodosius Dobzhansky (1973)

Dobzhansky was a key figure in the Modern Synthesis, a unifying framework in biology that integrated Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection with Mendelian genetics. His 1937 book, *Genetics and the Origin of Species*, was groundbreaking, demonstrating how genetic mutations and natural selection drive evolutionary change.

In this course, we will focus on the evolutionary biology of pathogens because they play a significant role in shaping the evolution of host species, ecosystems, and microbial communities. By studying their evolution, we gain insights into co-evolutionary dynamics and biodiversity. Some of the practical or selfish aspect of learning this course is listed below.

Practical Applications

- Modeling Epidemics: Predicting outbreak sizes, mutation rates, and transmission dynamics.
- Biotechnology: Using pathogen evolution to develop new molecular tools (e.g., CRISPR systems derived from bacterial immune responses to viruses).
- Agriculture: Managing crop and livestock diseases caused by evolving pathogens.
