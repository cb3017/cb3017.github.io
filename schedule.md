### **Objectives**  
1. Explain how principles of Darwinian evolution and population genetics apply to pathogens, with a focus on mutation, genetic drift, migration, and selection, to understand their adaptive strategies.  
2. Illustrate the evolutionary dynamics of antibiotic resistance and selective pressures in microbial populations, highlighting real-world scenarios like vaccine introduction and drug usage.  
3. Describe the molecular mechanisms of oncogenesis by viruses and their co-evolution with host immune systems, using case studies of oncogenic viruses.  
4. Explore evolutionary adaptations in plant pathogens in response to environmental changes, emphasizing co-evolution with hosts and using case studies to demonstrate key concepts like horizontal gene transfer and the Red Queen Hypothesis.  

### **Outcomes**  
1. Analyze and interpret the genetic and evolutionary forces shaping pathogen populations, including Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and deviations.  
2. Model evolutionary scenarios such as the emergence of antibiotic resistance or the effects of vaccines on pathogen fitness landscapes.  
3. Identify and evaluate molecular mechanisms of drug resistance or viral oncogenesis in pathogens using genomic tools.  
4. Apply evolutionary principles to real-world challenges in plant and microbial pathogens, including predicting pathogen adaptation to changing environmental or selective pressures.
