### **Objectives**  
1. Explain how principles of Darwinian evolution and population genetics apply to pathogens, with a focus on mutation, genetic drift, migration, and selection, to understand their adaptive strategies.  
2. Illustrate the evolutionary dynamics of antibiotic resistance and selective pressures in microbial populations, highlighting real-world scenarios like vaccine introduction and drug usage.  
3. Describe the molecular mechanisms of oncogenesis by viruses and their co-evolution with host immune systems, using case studies of oncogenic viruses.  
4. Explore evolutionary adaptations in plant pathogens in response to environmental changes, emphasizing co-evolution with hosts and using case studies to demonstrate key concepts like horizontal gene transfer and the Red Queen Hypothesis.  

### **Outcomes**  
1. Analyze and interpret the genetic and evolutionary forces shaping pathogen populations, including Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and deviations.  
2. Model evolutionary scenarios such as the emergence of antibiotic resistance or the effects of vaccines on pathogen fitness landscapes.  
3. Identify and evaluate molecular mechanisms of drug resistance or viral oncogenesis in pathogens using genomic tools.  
4. Apply evolutionary principles to real-world challenges in plant and microbial pathogens, including predicting pathogen adaptation to changing environmental or selective pressures.

### **Projects**  

- Create a tool to simulate microbial population in Rshiny or Jupter Notebook to model the effects of mutation, genetic drift, migration, and natural selection in a pathogen of your choice. Explore allele frequency from exisisting literature to check if the population is evolving as expected (Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium). How are is it different from existing tools like SLiM, Genepop on the web and simuPOP?

- Analyze genomic datasets of *E. coli*, or *K. pneumoniae*, or *M. tuberculosis* to identify the variability in resistance genes and identify fitness trade-offs using CARD and Snippy.

- Explore tools like VIRIDIC, BEAST, CoeViz 2, Signor 3.0 and HyPhy etc. to create models of viral protein-host interactions, identify genomic features driving oncogenesis, and explore co-evolutionary dynamics.

- Predict evolutionary trajectories of pathogens under varying climatic conditions and analyze co-evolutionary arms races using the Red Queen Hypothesis or similar. Explore USDA Integrated Pathogen Modeling Program – Dynamic Prediction and Maxent.
