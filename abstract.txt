The rainbow belly pipefish, Microphis deocata is a near threatened freshwater pipefish. It is a unique and ecologically significant species integral to the health and stability of freshwater ecosystems. However this species faces increasing threats from habitat degradation, water pollution and climate induced pressures. Little is known about its genetic diversity, population structure, or resilience to environmental challenges, despite its importance. This project aims to leverage advanced genomic tools to address these knowledge gaps aiming to inform and implement targeted conservation strategies. Through genotyping by sequencing (ddRAD-Seq), we will assess genetic diversity and identify distinct populations that serve as conservation units of M.deocata to ensure effective prioritization of critical habitats. By integrating results from genotyping with localized conservation and awareness campaigns this project bridges genomic data driven conservation efforts with practical outcomes. Importantly, the involvement of local communities will ensure the sustainability of interventions. This genotype led conservation efforts will serve a foundation for long term monitoring, fostering adaptive management strategies for M.deocata.
