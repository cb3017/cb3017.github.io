### Evolution of Fungal Plant Pathogens
Evolutionary mechanisms in plant pathogens, horizontal gene transfer, host jumps, and adaptive evolution in light of climate change. Co-evolution of plant hosts and pathogens, the arms race (Red Queen Hypothesis) and the gene-for-gene hypothesis. Case studies will include bacterial (*Xanthamonas*) and fungal species (*Phakopsora pachyrhizi* or similar and  *Phytophthora infestans* or similar)
